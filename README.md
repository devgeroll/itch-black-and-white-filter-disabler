Itch.io recently introduced a black and white filter on the dashboard for users who disable commission sharing. This Chrome extension restores full color by removing the forced filter, ensuring a normal viewing experience.

This extension simply removes the CSS filter that Itch.io applies to desaturate the dashboard, restoring the original look without modifying any other functionality.
